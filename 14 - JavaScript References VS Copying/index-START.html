    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
//   let age = 100;
//   let age2 = age;
//   console.log(age,age);
//   age = 200;
//   console.log(age,age2);
//
//   let name = 'Joey';
//   let name2 = name;
//   console.log(name,name2);
//   name='Joe';
//   console.log(name,name2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'blah blah';
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
//There is an error because both variables point to the same reference of the array, they work on the same data. <--
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); 
    // one day
    const team3 = Array.from(players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team4 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team5 = [...players]; //<-- USE THIS ONE IN ALL PROJ THAT ARE ABOVE IE11
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team5[3] = 'pew';
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team5);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name:'Joey',
      age:300
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    Object.assign({},person,{number:99});
    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
